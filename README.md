# Appscura

This is a community-driven curated collection of productivity apps.

If you ever found yourself looking for an app to help you organize your tasks or thoughts and had to read blogs and guides about it in different places then you get the idea behind this project.

Ok, enough talking, just try [Appscura](https://appscura.vercel.app/welcome/).
